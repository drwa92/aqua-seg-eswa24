# Aquaculture Defects Recognition via Multi-Scale Semantic Segmentation

Semantic segmentation framework to detect **biofouling**, **vegetation**, and **net holes** on aquaculture net pens using underwater imagery.  
It implements a **multi-scale encoder–decoder** with three custom blocks—**Identity Block (IB)**, **Shape-Preservation Block (SPB)**, and **Hierarchical Decomposition Block (HDB)**—and a tailored **L_t** loss that blends two sub-objectives to handle class imbalance and stabilize convergence.

## ✨ Highlights

- **Multi-scale encoder–decoder**: fuses features from *multiple encoder depths* (“butterfly” topology) to be robust to noise and preserve defect shape.
- **Custom blocks**:
  - **IB** (residual-style) → discriminative features while preserving geometry
  - **SPB** → keeps the *shape* of defect regions
  - **HDB** → fuses coarse↔fine representations across scales
- **L_t loss** (with weights β₁, β₂ and temperature τ) → soft targets for stable learning under heavy background/foreground imbalance.
- **Validated on four datasets** with real fish-farm imagery:
  - **LABUST** (156,600 imgs): biofouling, vegetation
  - **KU** (37,926 imgs): vegetation, holes
  - **NDv1** (1,864 imgs): biofouling, vegetation
  - **NDv2** (1,411 imgs): biofouling, vegetation
- **Outperforms SOTA** on mAP across all four datasets (e.g., +6.58% on LABUST).

## 🏗️ Architecture (at a glance)

- Encoder aggregates multi-resolution features; latent features are taken from **multiple depths** rather than only the top.
- **HDB** blends features with average pooling + conv + BN + ReLU across scales; **SPB** preserves geometry with residual fusion; **IB** follows a ResNet-style pattern.
- Decoder is asymmetric and upsamples via **strided convolutions** (not bilinear interpolation) for sharper masks.
